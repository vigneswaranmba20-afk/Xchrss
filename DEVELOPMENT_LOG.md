# VER Chess — development log

## 2026-11-08 · v7.3 Learn observation quiz (PR pending)
- Added original, offline, FEN-based **back-rank geometry** questions with detector-checked yes/no feedback; isolated module, not yet wired into the Learn UI.
- Added Node regression tests for positive/negative fixtures, input validation and non-misleading explanations.
- **Release gate:** PR CI, Chromium mobile/PWA regression and GitHub Pages deployment not yet verified. Do not describe this as a deployed feature.
- Baseline: main commit `7cc17419d897b6cd5bd5414ed45a80af0399247c` (PR #23). No production board files changed.
- Outstanding: verify Pages deployment for main, integrate accessible Learn UI and offline caching in a separate tested PR; physical Android verification remains pending.

## 2026-11-08 · v7.3 tactical foundations
- PRs #18–#23 previously merged, adding and testing skewer, discovered-attack and back-rank geometry observations.
- Pre-merge GitHub Actions stability runs were reported passing for PRs #18–#23, but post-merge Pages deployment has not been independently confirmed. Geometry is **not** proof of legal checkmate, forced wins, or objective move accuracy.
